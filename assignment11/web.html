        <p>My name is Jay, and I love making games.  I tried making games off and on for a while when I was younger, but eventually, I got it in my head that since I was good at math, I had to go into a career involving numbers, or I would be wasting my potential. Thankfully, I had an amazing teacher who emphasized creativity above all else and encouraged me to think about what I actually wanted to do career-wise. With his tutelage, I rediscovered my joy for making games, and now I am attending university in the hopes of eventually making video games full-time.</p>

        <p>So far I have worked on a couple of physical games, the basics of audio design, and web design. For information on me, feel free to scroll through the site, and come back later as this will be updated as time progresses and my skills develop!
