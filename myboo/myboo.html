      <p>I was born on 11/29/2004, and that entire month the number one song per the <a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/2004-11-27/"><span id="italic">Billboard</span> Hot 100</a> was "My Boo" from Usher and Alicia Keys, the music video to which is embedded to the right. <br><br>With no idea what to put on this page, I figure the best I can do is give my opinion on the song, which you can read below.</p>

      <p>So, at first, when I looked this up, I had no idea what song this was, and considering it was written when I was a baby, I think that's understandable. Then I started watching the music video, and I found myself disliking it. I couldn't relate to the subject matter, and it felt incredibly objectifying. I was convinced this would be bland party music that I would forget listening to once the song was over.<br><br>
      Then the music stopped.<br><br>
      Usher sits on the couch in a dimly lit room and just sits for a bit, and then the song just switches and becomes a love song, playing off of the sexual nature of the intro to show the difference between it and the far deeper, more romantic feelings he has for this woman.<br><br>
      From there, the chorus picked up, and then I recognized the song, but I was still focused on that moment of silence between the intro and the real song, and now I imagine this song will stick in my head much longer, simply because of how well that moment challenged my expectations.</p>
