        <p>I have done a little bit with audio, mostly in terms of sound effects. Bellow are some of my audio projects, which you can read about and even listen to!

            <p>The song here is Trocadero's Good Fight, written by Nicolas Audy-Rowland and was used in the popular web series Red vs Blue. Here, I have shortened the five-minute song to two minutes, showing my technical ability to isolate segments of a song and reorder them to resemble an original track while also displaying my creative sound craft.</p>

        <div class="word">
            <p>This audio is a completely original story told expressly through sounds and built out of dozens of audio files and separate tracks, which represents the culmination of my audio design skills up to this point. For anyone interested, the story is of someone going to a Renaissance festival and finding a mysterious item in a shop, which they then buy.</p>
